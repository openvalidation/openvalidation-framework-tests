## Introduction

This is a collection of projects containting unit tests for any generated HUMLFramework codefile (the validation framework generated by [openValidation](https://github.com/openvalidation/openvalidation)).

## Build and Test

Refer to README files in any subfolder

- [CSharp](OpenValidationFramework-CSharp/README.md)

## Testing an updated version of HUMLFramework

Replace the HUMLFramework file in any project, then run tests to confirm stability of generated framework. Details on what files to replace, and what parameters to use for each language can be found on the `README.md` for each language.

## Contribute

### General fixes, improvements and additional test cases

Add the name of the framework you commited on in each commit, so the history is cleaner to read.

Like ``[csharp] added Testcases for comparisons``.

### Adding new Languages

see [Add a new language translation for HUMLFramework](AddNewLanguage.md).

### Testing

All Languages have a FrameworkTesting.md file in their respective Folder.
Please document all tested functionalities in these files, so any contributor can use those files as a checklist for completeness of functionality (even if ne functions are added to the Framework).

### Extend Framework functionality

When planning on adding additional functionality to the Framework, please refer to [Add Features to HUMLFramework](NewFeatures.md).
