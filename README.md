# OpenValidation HUMLFramework Test Projects

## Introduction

This is a collection of Projects containting unit tests for any generated HUMLFramework codefile.

## Build and Test

Refer to README files in any subfolder

- [CSharp](OpenValidationFramework-CSharp/README.md)
- [Java](OpenValidationFramework-Java/README.md)
- [Javascript](OpenValidationFramework-Javascript/README.md)
- [Javascript - Node](OpenValidationFramework-Node/README.md)

## Update Framework Codefile

Replace the HUMLFramework file in any project, then run tests to confirm stability of generated framework.

## Contribute

Add the name of the framework you commited on in each commit, so the history is cleaner to read.

Like ``[csharp] added Testcases for comparisons``.

### Adding new Languages

see [Add a new language translation for HUMLFramework](AddNewLanguage.md).

### Testing

All Languages have a FrameworkTesting.md file in their respective Folder.
Please document all tested functionalities in these files, so any contributor can use those files as a checklist for completeness of functionality (even if ne functions are added to the Framework).
